All solutions are present!
PR's were used to merge code into the main branch, very good!
Reviewers looked at the code
CI checks passed!
Not all checklist items in the PR are completed by the reviewer!
Some people committed directly in the main branch, this should never happen

Near perfect solution, very impressive!
